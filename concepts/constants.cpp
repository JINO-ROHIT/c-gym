// a big part of compiel time programming is constant expressions
// In a constant expression, each part of the expression must be evaluatable at compile-time.

// Const integral variables with a constant expression initializer can be used in constant expressions:
const int a { 5 };           // a is usable in constant expressions
const int b { a };           // b is usable in constant expressions (a is a constant expression per the prior statement)
const long c { a + 2 };      // c is usable in constant expressions (operator+ has constant expression operands)

// Other variables cannot be used in constant expressions (even when they have a constant expression initializer):
int d { 5 };                 // d is not usable in constant expressions (d is non-const)
const int e { d };           // e is not usable in constant expressions (initializer is not a constant expression)
const double f { 1.2 };      // f is not usable in constant expressions (not a const integral variable)
